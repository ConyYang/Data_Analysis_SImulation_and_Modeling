# Simulation and Modeling

This is NTU CZ4015 project.<br/>
This assignment sets out to model and simulate a cellular telephony network on a long highway 
to determine whether the system can meet the quality of service requirements. 
The evaluation metrics are the percentages of dropped calls and blocked calls.
